Use Case
A simulator helps the users continuously measure and access the brightness level of the surrounding lights.
Moreover, if it is combined with the Infrared Sensor than the light can turn off automatically based on the no movement detected thereby saving energy.
A relay is used to actually control the 230V based lights in the home on a HAN. 

Worked on the Raspberry Pi3, Virtual Network Connectivity, Relay and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
